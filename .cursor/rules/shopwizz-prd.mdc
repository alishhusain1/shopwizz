PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)

Product Name: ShopWizz.ai
Version: MVP v1.0

Overview:
ShopWizz.ai is a responsive web application (desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile) with best-in-class mobile optimization, offering AI-powered personal shopping assistance primarily on Amazon. Users navigate to the site, upload images, enter text, or use voice prompts to describe desired products. Leveraging GPT-4 and ElevenLabs voice APIs, ShopWizz.ai returns ranked Amazon product links with embedded affiliate tags, AI-generated star ratings, and concise “Why buy” summaries. Customers filter results by price, brand, quality, reviews, shipping time, and pickup availability. Revenue is earned solely via Amazon Associates affiliate partnerships.
